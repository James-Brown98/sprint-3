*What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px? How do you think that works?*

The skeleton framework is a mobile-first design, therefore, the design is created for width < 550 px initially. So essentially, if you resize the screen to 550 px on a webpage which uses the skeleton framework then this is taking it to its natural appearance.

However, if the webpage isn't using the skeleton framework then this is the breakpoint at which a responsive design will change to the mobile version.
